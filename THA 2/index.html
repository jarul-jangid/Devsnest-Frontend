  Respected Ma'am,<br>
  This is to bring to your notice that <strong>Devsnest</strong>, a non-profit organisation is organising a <strong> 30-days free Coding Camp</strong>. Here the students <br>will learn about Frontend Development from industry experts working at reputed companies. The organisation is founded by our<br> Alumni <strong> Kshitiz Miglani</strong> and <strong> Vedansh Garg</strong>. I myself have been a part of their organisation and have learned a lot in the past month,<br> I am confident that students who attend this Camp will do great in the Placement and Internship season as they will have one-on-one<br> guidance from industry experts.<br>
  <br>
  Thus, I'd like you to consider this opportunity and collaborate with Devsnest. If you wish to have further conversation kindly reply to<br> this mail to set up a call for the process ahead. You can also reach out to us at <em>contact@devsnest.in</em><br>
  <br>
  Thank you for your time. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
  Yours sincerely,<br>
  <b>Jarul Jangid.<br>
    2nd year, ECE.<br></b>
